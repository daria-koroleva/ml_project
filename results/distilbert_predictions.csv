"PLEASE READ! Dear Sir/madam, First, I must apologise to you for using this medium to communicate about this transaction,though it is my great pleasure in writing you this letter. This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. I have to say that I have no intentions of causing you any pains so i decided to contact you through this medium. As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. My name is AHMED SALIH BERHAM, a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal Cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and right now, I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even myself but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near, I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate and extended family members and as well as a few close friends and Schools in the UAE. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, London and Ireland. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and donate the money, which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which is the huge cash deposit that I have with Financial Firm Abroad .I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and let them know that it is I AHMED SALIH BERHAM that is making this generous donation. I pray that you assist me with good heart,because my lawyer will be there to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper documentation. Like I said,I will prefer you contact my lawyer for further information. Contact information is as provided below; Name: David Morgan Tel: +31 645 551 264 Email: admin@services-investcorp.com You should inform the Attorney you were referred by AHMED SALIH BERHAM. NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter untill the task is accomplished as I dont want anything that will Jeopadize my last wish. and Also I will be contacting with you by email as I dont want anybody to know because they are always around me.",1,1,0.9966157078742981,True

"[UAI] Workshop: Gaussian Processes in Practice Registration is now open for the following workshop: Gaussian Processes in Practice Bletchley Park, U.K. (where the Enigma machine was decoded) 12th & 13th June 2006 There has been a recent upsurge in interest in Gaussian processes for solving a variety of machine learning problems. Simultaneously there have been recent rapid developments in efficient approximation techniques for Gaussian processes and novel unifying theories of existing approximation techniques. This workshop will bring experts in Gaussian processes together with individuals who are using Gaussian processes at the forefront of research in their fields. We will start with a set of talks that will relate the latest developments in Gaussian processes while the second portion of talks will discuss application fields where Gaussian processes are being applied as state-of-the-art technologies: Robotics, Graphics and Vision. Speakers Include: David MacKay Carl Rasmussen Ed Snelson Chris Williams Dieter Fox Aaron Hertzmann Raquel Urtasun The workshop is expected to be an ideal entry point to a researcher interested in using Gaussian processes, but at the same time, by bringing together acknowledged experts in Gaussian processes with acknowledged experts in the application areas mentioned above we expect to drive forward research in novel directions. We invite submissions to the workshop of *no more than four pages* in length using the LaTeX article class file in one column with standard margin settings and 11pt font. The submission deadline is Friday May 19th. It is our intention to create a post-proceedings for the workshop. Registration for the workshop will close on Friday 26th May.

I think the laws specialing out hate and protected speech are ridiculous. The point I keep trying to make is that there's only two types, speech and action. I agree, they are all speech and should be covered by the First Amendment, but If hate speech is so protected, why are certain states trying to prosecute people for it? There's only two answers and one of them is wrong. 1) Because hate speech is different and needs to have a different level of protection dictated by whoever's offended at the time. 2) It's because it's not just speech, but action. A action who's consequences are foreseeable by any reasonable person. Hate speech is mislabeled. It's really ""threat"". I think they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY don't like.

I presume the certificate was presented to the IdP, so I would count any time the *IdP* walks through an authentication sequence as being an authentication event that would/could impact the AuthnInstant. The case that Tom brought up did not walk through a new authentication sequence at the IdP, but rather used the existing ""session"" with the user.

I think it is pretty clear as it is, so I don't think it needs a change, but I disagree with this reasoning.

"re : biz , the momentum investor report domingo hurst , sequoia interests trading symbol sqnc pk what if a company had a product that would allow oil wells to produce much more oil ? what would that stock be worth with todays oil prices close to 50 usd per barrel ? 10 , 20 , 30 , 100 usd ? and now several of the major oil companies are currently testing the product . at 0 . 50 we think sqnc is a homerun . to solve this problem , the oil industry is looking for new alternatives for increased exploration and production . the clear solution for increased demand and consumption can already be found in the ground , with nearly two thirds of oil left in the ground at us wells , too technically complex or expensive to extract with traditional technologies . enhanced oil recovery , eor , is an exciting new frontier in the oil and gas industry which you are going to hear more of in the coming years . sqncs innovative new product , diamondflo , could be at the forefront of this frontier . sqnc has strong interest from major oil and gas companies for testing and potential licensing of this product , and is in the final stages of the research and development of diamondflo . with testing expected to be completed in the next 60 to 90 days , and planned patent application shortly thereafter , announcements from sqnc could cause price gains for this stock over the coming months . what is more , diamondflos unique chemical properties , make it an ideal solution for a number of other application in the oil and gas industry , including remediation and environmental cleanup of oil fields , refineries , and storage facilities ; an estimated 8 . 1 billion market . with this revolutionary product in the development pipeline , sqnc has also made some aggressive moves into oil and gas production with its recent acquisition of leases in pecos valley , texas . these operations will act as a testbed for development and validation of the diamondflo product and could provide an additional revenue stream and source of cash flow for sqnc . with the commercialization of its diamondflo product looming near , we feel that it is only a matter of time before wall street recognizes this stock . what is more , sqnc is positioned within an industry that has seen tremendous upside growth , and is headed for even more appreciation as the global oil crisis demands new production solutions . over the last twelve months , the oil well services and equipment industry has seen an average price gain of more than 88 percent , and savvy investors in emerging companies have witnessed tremendous profits . we believe that sqnc is one of the most revolutionary new companies on the market . with major announcements stemming from the completion of r and d on diamondflo , do you think sqnc could make a nice move in the coming day ? . a few reasons to own sqnc . 1 . with its innovative diamondflo product , sqnc is positioned to help alleviate the impending oil and gas crisis , with producers struggling to keep up with growing us energy demands , as foreign exploration and production comes under increasing geopolitical pressures . increased consumption demands have combined with an increasingly unstable international production climate to create some of the highest prices seen at the pump since the 1970 s oil embargo , and crude oil prices on the spot market have recently approached the 50 usd mark . as oil companies seek new ways to maximize domestic oil recovery , the chemical eor approach of sqnc will be a major factor in increasing production and removing dependence on foreign oil . 2 . enhanced oil recovery , eor , represents the logical next step in expanding domestic oil production , and represents a tremendous and presently underappreciated market potential . over two thirds of oil in us reservoirs is left unproduced after primary and secondary production , leaving an incredible and untapped source for us energy needs . according to the us department of energy , eor has the potential to recover 35 billion barrels of oil , 50 percent more than the current us proven reserves of 23 billion barrels , and even greater than the us estimated undiscovered potential of 30 billion barrels . with its diamondflo chemical eor solution , sqnc could be ideally positioned to benefit from a renewed focus on production from these untapped oil reserves . 3 . sqnc has developed a revolutionary chemical eor product , diamondflo which offers tremendous advantages over thermal and gas eor methods . thermal and gas , primarily co 2 injection to stimulate production are costly and require a complex infrastructure , while other chemical eor products have had limited success and are environmentally damaging . by contrast , diamondflo is expected to generate recovery of 20 to 40 percent above current methods , is environmentally safe and meets strict regulatory standards for oil recovery and remediation , and will be available to producers at a comparable price point to competitive products . with introduction of diamondflo to the market following completion of testing and development , sqnc could revolutionize the oil and gas industry with this innovative approach to enhanced oil recovery . 4 . in addition to its principal application in eor , sqncs diamondflo product has additional applications in the 8 . 1 billion oil and gas remediation market . during the testing process , diamondflo has demonstrated exceptional remediation properties , with static remediation tests determining that it removed more than 80 percent of hydrocarbons from soil with no significant hydrocarbon emulsion , mixing of oil and water . this discovery paves the way for eventual application in environmental cleanup of oil facilities or spills , and opens up a tremendous new market for sqnc . since 1992 , the american petroleum industry estimates that over 90 billion has been spent by the oil and gas industry to protect the environment , with 8 . 1 billion spent annually in environmental expenditures . this publication is an independent publication with the goal of giving investors the necessary knowledge to make

"[UAI] ArgMAS 2008: Final CFP Apologies for multiple receipts. -- Fifth International Workshop on Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems (ArgMAS 2008) Estoril, Portugal, May 12 or 13, 2008 In Conjunction with AAMAS 2008 (http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/irahwan/argmas/argmas08/) - Overview: Argumentation can be abstractly defined as the interaction of different arguments for and against some conclusion. Over the last few years, argumentation has been gaining increasing importance in multi-agent systems, mainly as a vehicle for facilitating ""rational interaction"" (i.e., interaction which involves the giving and receiving of reasons). This is because argumentation provides tools for designing, implementing and analysing sophisticated forms of interaction among rational agents. Argumentation has made solid contributions to the practice of multi-agent dialogues. Application domains include: legal disputes, business negotiation, labor disputes, team formation, scientific inquiry, deliberative democracy, ontology reconciliation, risk analysis, scheduling, and logistics. A single agent may also use argumentation techniques to perform its individual reasoning because it needs to make decisions under complex preferences policies, in a highly dynamic environment. This workshop builds on three successful workshops: * ArgMAS 2007 held in conjunction with AAMAS 2007, in Honolulu, Hawai'i, USA (attracted 22 participants) * ArgMAS 2006 held in conjunction with AAMAS 2006, at Future University, Hakodate, Japan (attracted 21 participants) * ArgMAS 2005 held in conjunction with AAMAS 2005, at Universiteit Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands (attracted 31 participants) * ArgMAS 2004 held in conjunction with AAMAS 2004, at Columbia University, New York, USA (attracted 20 participants) Post-proceedings of previous editions of the workshop have been published in Springer LNCS volumes: 3366, 4049 and 4766. Topics: We solicit papers dealing with, but not limited to, the following areas: * Computational models for argumentation * Argumentation-based decision making * Argumentation-based joint deliberation * Argumentation-based persuasion * Argumentation-based inquiry * Argumentation-based negotiation and conflict resolution * Argumentation and risk assessment * Argumentation for legal reasoning * Argumentation for electronic democracy * Argumentation for coordination, cooperation and team formation * Argumentation and game theory in multi-agent systems * Human-agent argumentation * Argumentation and preferences modelling * Strategic behaviour in argument-based dialogues * Deception, trust, reputation in argument-based interaction * Computational complexity of argumentation dialogues * Properties of argumentation dialogues (termination, success, etc.) * Hybrid argumentation-based models * Implemented argumentation-based multi-agent systems * New application areas Publication: The proceedings of ArgMAS will be printed and distributed at the workshop. As done with previous ArgMAS workshops, it is planned to publish revised versions of the accepted full papers in an edited book as part of the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. This publication would have an ISBN number, and would be available both in printed form, as well as electronically on the SpringerLink online library. Important Dates: Note that the dates are fixed by the AAMAS conference: Submission Deadline: 25 January 2008 Notification of Acceptance/Rejection: 25 February 2008 Camera Ready Due: 5 March 2008 Workshop: 12 or 13 May 2008 (to be confirmed) Submission procedure: Contributors may submit either full papers (no longer than 5000 words, not including figures) or a two page position statement that outlines their interests, background, and discussion of an aspect of the workshop theme.

A lot of the TV sketches were recycled radio sketches that didn't work so well on TV. But the new stuff was all great.

"[UAI] CfP FOCLASA'05 at CONCUR 2005: Foundations of Coordination Languages and Software Architectures FOCLASA 2005 4th International Workshop on the Foundations of Coordination Languages and Software Architectures A Satellite Workshop of CONCUR 2005 August 27, 2005 San Francisco, Californa (USA) http://foclasa05.lcc.uma.es Abstract A number of hot research topics are currently sharing the common problem of combining concurrent, distributed, mobile and heterogenous components, trying to harness the intrinsic complexity of the resulting systems. These include coordination, peer-to-peer systems, grid computing, web-services, multi-agent systems, and component-based systems. Coordination languages and software architectures are recognised as fundamental approaches to tackle these issues, improving software productivity, enhancing maintainability, advocating modularity, promoting reusability, and leading to systems more tractable and more amenable to verification and global analysis. The goal of this workshop is to put together researchers and practitioners of the aforementioned fields, to share and identify common problems, and to devise general solutions in the contexts of coordination languages and software architectures. Topics of interest Topics of interest include (but are not limited to): * Theoretical models (coordination, component composition, concurrency, semantics, expressiveness); * Specification, refinement, and analysis of software systems (architectures, patterns and styles, verification of functional and non-functional properties); * Languages for interaction, coordination, architectures, and interface definition (implementation, interoperability, heterogeneity); * Dynamic software architectures (mobile agents, self-organizing/adaptive/reconfigurable systems); * Tools and environments for the development of applications. In particular, practice, experience and methodologies from the following areas are solicited as well: - Web-services - Multi-agent systems - Peer-to-peer systems - Grid computing - Component-based systems Call for Papers = FOCLASA 2005 is a satellite workshop of the 16th International Conference on Concurrency Theory (CONCUR 2005). The workshop will be held at same location as CONCUR 2005 on August 27, 2005, one day after the main conference. The workshop tries to provide a venue where researchers and practitioners on the topics above can meet, exchange ideas and problems, identify some of the key and fundamental issues related to coordination languages and software architecture, and explore together and disseminate solutions. FOCLASA 2005 invites the submission of technical papers in any of the topics of interest and areas listed above. Submissions must describe authors’ original research work and their results. Description of work-in-progress is also encouraged. The contributions should not exceed 15 pages formatted according to the style of the Electronic Notes on Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS), and should be emailed as PostScript (PS) or Portable Document Format (PDF) files to foclasa05@lcc.uma.es. All submissions will be reviewed by an international program committee that will select them for presentation in the workshop. Selected papers will be available through the workshop website, and a printed version of the proceedings will be distributed among participants during the workshop. The proceedings of the workshop will be published in Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science (ENTCS). Participants will make a presentation of their papers (about twenty or twenty five minutes maximum), followed by a five to ten minutes round of questions and discussion on participants’ work. The workshop will also include a closing panel in which several issues related to the topics of the workshop and some issues raised during the workshop will be discussed. The Panel Chair (to determine) will invite the panelists and moderate the debate. The publication of a special issue on FOCLASA 2005 in an international scientific journal is also being prepared. Selected participants will be invited to submit an extended version of their papers after the workshop. These extended versions will be reviewed by an international program committee, which will decide on their final publication on the special issue. Previous editions of FOCLASA have been published on Fundamenta Informaticae and Science of Computer Programming.

2 ) volatility : i found winston ' s examples on this metric succinct . i would recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this subject . my criticism again relates to messy problems . i anticipate arguments against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility measures . if i were a conservative financial manager , i would argue that : * * * two - a : implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of equity options is a shotgun approach - - the projects being valued are of a tranche which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the weighted average measured by the equities utilized . oil , gas and electricty are good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of the value chain . smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata , but what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a vertically integrated company ? * * * two - b : based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is being proposed for a new business venture ( some new unexploited opportunity , ) there is some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new ventures and the high risk of failure . this skepticism is likely to be less acute in high - tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded before us daily by nasdq touts . it is a much harder sell to "" mature "" industries . of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas sectors as regulation is removed . a large proportion of the risk is embedded in ongoing changes of public policy on an international basis . as an intentionally screwed - up example , can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses volatility for u . s . companies investing in seed projects in mexico based on speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility ( cfe ) and pemex ?

"re : comments fyi . forwarded by rakesh bharati / na / enron on 03 / 27 / 2001 07 : 43 pm sheridan titman on 03 / 27 / 2001 06 : 46 : 31 pm to : rakesh . bharati @ enron . com cc : subject : re : comments rakesh : thanks for your input . they are quite useful for helping me clarify my own thinking . the following are my responses to your comments and clarifications . the * * ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you . 1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm anymore . * * i agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement . i do this because i have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows , ( this is discussed in my first memo ) . this clearly provides a conservative estimate of firm value , and a measure of risk capital that is too high . from the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital , it is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the pv at each node is positive . also , one might want to set the level so that the pv is positive in say 98 % of all nodes . 2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not have a positive debt capacity . * * again , this is a very conservative initial estimate . when the model is refined , you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project defaults a certain percent of the time . 3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . * * i am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect on volatility . in fact , i think the process requires only one iteration when the volatility is independent of the discount rate . again , the idea is that we calculate the volatility of the project ' s value calculated with an initial discount rate . using the calculated volatility and the stock of a comparison firm , calculate a more appropriate discount rate . if the volatility of the project ' s value is not affected by the change in discount rates then we are done . if , however , the change in discount rates changes volatility , then we may have to iterate . let me know if this makes sense . * * also , our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ? is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ? * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance , but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate , which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * * 4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines the discount rate . * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the kind of projects that you are evaluating . * * gas field case to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below . we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of expected production and variance of the production per year is available from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this problem . * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing . hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash flows of the gas field . please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not necessarily straightforward . * * let me know when you would like to discuss this . * on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like the following information : 1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price ) 2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract . 3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options . about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to try applying the model for one case study . let me know when you want to discuss these issues . thanks , sheridan sheridan titman department of finance college of business administration university of texas austin , texas 78712 - 1179 512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone ) 512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax ) titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0,0,0.00021625931549351662,True
